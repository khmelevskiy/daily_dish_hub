- **Bugs:** provide clear reproduction steps, expected vs actual behaviour, and whether you ran the stack via Docker or locally.
- **Security concerns:** follow the disclosure process in [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) and open a private issue.
- **Feature ideas / improvements:** describe the problem you want to solve and any constraints you already considered.

If you want to experiment locally before filing an issue, the docs cover everything you need:

- Setup: [docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md)
- Architecture & data flow: [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)
- Testing guidance: [tests/README.md](tests/README.md)
